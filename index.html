    <p>Through cycling and later driving, I would deliver medicines to elderly people in the local area twice a week and frequently overtime as and when required. Given the critical nature of the deliveries, it was essential that I was reliable and trustworthy – something demonstrated during the 4 years I held the role. Over this time I built strong relationships with many of the clients I regularly visited and enjoyed the high level of customer service and responsibility needed for the role.<br><br>As my customers were elderly and often very unwell, I developed the communication and interpersonal skills necessary to gain good feedback to the pharmacist and most importantly, make them feel they had reliable service and an understanding of their situation, which was critical to their health and wellbeing.
